# Swift Language Fundamentals

Swift is a modern programming language for Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, etc.) with these key characteristics:

1. Core Features:
- Type inference for automatic type detection
- Optionals for safe handling of missing values
- Closures for flexible function passing
- Memory safety by design
- Built-in error handling
- Interactive development via Swift Playgrounds and REPL

2. Syntax Example:
```swift
// Dictionary with type inference and array manipulation
var interestingNumbers = [
    "primes": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17],
    "triangular": [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]
]
for key in interestingNumbers.keys {
    interestingNumbers[key]?.sort(by: >) // Safe optional access with ?
}
```

3. Standard Library Foundation:
- Int: Signed integer values
- Double: Floating-point numbers
- String: Unicode text handling
- Array: Ordered collections
- Dictionary: Key-value pair collections

4. Key Capabilities:
- Concurrency support with strict checking
- Regular expression handling
- Atomic operations for synchronization
- Interoperability with Objective-C and C++
- Actor system for distributed computing

Best Practice: Prefer Swift's modern syntax and safety features over older Objective-C patterns when building new applications for Apple platforms.

# Integer Types

The Int type in Swift provides signed integer functionality with platform-specific sizing:

1. Core Characteristics:
- 32-bit on 32-bit platforms (same as Int32)
- 64-bit on 64-bit platforms (same as Int64)
- Signed integer (can represent positive and negative values)

2. Key Operations:
```swift
// Basic initialization
let x = Int(42)  // From literal
let y = Int("123")  // From string, returns optional
let z = Int("ABC")  // Returns nil for invalid strings

// Random number generation
let random = Int.random(in: 1...100)  // Random between 1-100 inclusive

// Common properties
Int.min  // Minimum value
Int.max  // Maximum value
Int.zero // Zero value
someInt.magnitude  // Absolute value as UInt
```

3. Common Conversions:
- To/from floating point: Int(3.14) truncates to 3
- Safe conversion: Int(exactly: someValue) returns optional
- String parsing: Int("123", radix: 16) for different bases
- Bit patterns: Int(bitPattern: someUInt)

4. Safety Features:
```swift
// Overflow handling
let (sum, didOverflow) = someInt.addingReportingOverflow(otherInt)
if didOverflow {
    // Handle overflow case
}

// Safe division
let (quotient, remainder) = someInt.quotientAndRemainder(dividingBy: otherInt)
```

Best Practice: Use Int as the default integer type unless you specifically need a different size or unsigned integers. For better safety, use the overflow-checking operations when dealing with potentially large values.

# Structures vs Classes

Swift offers both structures and classes for data modeling. Here are the key differences and when to use each:

1. Default Choice - Structures:
- Use structures by default for most data types
- Value type semantics (copies on assignment)
- Support properties, methods, and protocol adoption
- Safer state management (changes are explicit)
- Used by Swift standard library (String, Array, etc.)

2. When to Use Classes:
```swift
// Classes for identity/reference semantics
class DatabaseConnection {
    let connectionId: String
    // Two instances with same connectionId are still different objects
    // Changes to a shared instance are visible everywhere
}

// Use === for identity comparison
if connection1 === connection2 {
    // Same exact instance
}
```

3. Common Class Use Cases:
- When needing Objective-C interoperability
- Managing shared resources (file handles, network connections)
- When object identity is important
- For inheritance hierarchies from Objective-C frameworks

4. Structure Best Practices:
```swift
// Example of good structure usage
struct Record {
    let id: Int // Immutable identifier
    var nickname: String // Mutable property
    
    // Value semantics mean changes are isolated
    mutating func updateNickname(_ new: String) {
        nickname = new
    }
}
```

Best Practice: Model inheritance using protocols with structures instead of class inheritance when possible. This provides more flexibility since protocols can be adopted by any type, while class inheritance is limited to classes.

# Type Casting and Dynamic Types

Swift provides robust type casting capabilities, especially when working with dynamic or uncertain types:

1. Working with Any Type:
```swift
// Any can hold any type (value or reference)
var x: Any = "hello"
let str = x as? String    // Optional downcast
let nsStr = x as? NSString // Can bridge to NSString too

// Forced downcast when certain
let definiteString = x as! String  // Crashes if wrong type
```

2. Common Use Cases:
```swift
// Safe type casting from APIs
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
if let date = defaults.object(forKey: "LastRefreshDate") as? Date {
    // Work with date safely
}

// Collection type casting
let mixedArray: [Any] = [1, "two", 3.0]
for item in mixedArray {
    switch item {
    case let number as Int: print("Int: \(number)")
    case let text as String: print("String: \(text)")
    case let decimal as Double: print("Double: \(decimal)")
    default: print("Unknown type")
    }
}
```

3. Type Casting Best Practices:
- Prefer `as?` for safe optional downcasting
- Use `as!` only when type is guaranteed
- Handle Objective-C `id` types automatically bridged as `Any`
- Use type casting in switch statements for elegant type checking

Best Practice: Always use conditional downcasting (`as?`) unless you are absolutely certain of the type to avoid runtime crashes. When working with collections of mixed types, consider using proper Swift enums or protocols instead of `Any` when possible.

# Floating-Point Square Root Operations

Swift provides in-place mutation methods for calculating square roots on floating-point numbers, specifically for the `Double` type:

1. In-Place Square Root Calculation:
```swift
var value = 16.0
value.formSquareRoot()  // Directly modifies 'value' to 4.0
```

2. Immutable Square Root Calculation:
```swift
let originalValue = 25.0
let squareRoot = originalValue.squareRoot()  // Returns 5.0 without modifying original
```

3. Key Characteristics:
- Mutating `formSquareRoot()` changes the original value
- `squareRoot()` returns a new value
- Rounds result to nearest representable floating-point number
- Works with positive numbers
- Returns `NaN` for negative inputs

Best Practice: 
- Use `squareRoot()` when you want to preserve the original value
- Use `formSquareRoot()` for in-place modifications to reduce memory allocation
- Always handle potential edge cases like negative numbers or `NaN`

# Debugging and Reflection in Swift

Swift provides robust debugging and runtime introspection capabilities that help developers understand and diagnose their code:

1. Printing and Output:
```swift
// Standard printing
print("Hello, world!")  // Standard output
debugPrint(object)      // More detailed debugging output

// Dump provides deep introspection of an object
dump(someComplexObject)  // Prints detailed object structure
```

2. Runtime Type Checking:
```swift
// Dynamically check types
let dynamicType = type(of: someValue)

// Compare types
if type(of: object1) == type(of: object2) {
    // Types are identical
}
```

3. Debugging Assertions:
```swift
// Soft assertions (debug builds only)
assert(condition, "Explanation of failed condition")

// Hard preconditions (always checked)
precondition(value > 0, "Value must be positive")

// Immediate failure
fatalError("Unrecoverable error occurred")
```

4. Custom Reflection:
```swift
// Implement custom reflection for your types
extension MyType: CustomReflectable {
    var customMirror: Mirror {
        // Define how your type should be inspected
    }
}
```

Best Practices:
- Use `print()` for normal logging
- Use `debugPrint()` for more detailed debugging information
- Prefer `assert()` for development-time checks
- Use `precondition()` for runtime checks that must always occur
- Implement `CustomReflectable` to provide rich type inspection

# Concurrency and Swift 6: Strict Data Race Prevention

1. Core Concept:
Swift 6 introduces strict concurrency checking to prevent data races at compile-time, catching potential threading issues before runtime.

2. Key Benefits:
- Compile-time detection of overlapping access to shared mutable state
- Prevents crashes, data corruption, and hard-to-reproduce threading bugs
- Systematically improves app reliability and performance

3. Adoption Strategies:
```swift
// Enable strict concurrency checking in Xcode build settings
// Swift Compiler - Upcoming Features: Select concurrency checking
// Swift Compiler - Language: Set to Swift 6 language version
```

4. Migration Approach:
- Can upgrade gradually (module by module)
- Start with minimal concurrency checking
- Progressively increase strictness
- Can temporarily revert to Swift 5 if needed

5. Best Practices:
- Fix data races by:
  - Eliminating overlapping access
  - Reducing shared mutable state
  - Using Swift's concurrency primitives
- Don't try to fix all issues at once
- Prioritize critical modules first

Key Takeaway: Strict concurrency checking is a proactive way to build more reliable, thread-safe Swift applications by catching potential issues during compilation.

# Dictionaries in Swift: Key-Value Storage and Manipulation

1. Core Definition:
- A hash table-like collection storing key-value pairs
- Keys must conform to the `Hashable` protocol
- Provides fast, efficient key-based access

2. Creating Dictionaries:
```swift
// Literal initialization
var responseMessages = [200: "OK", 403: "Access forbidden"]

// Empty dictionary
var emptyDict: [String: String] = [:]
```

3. Accessing and Modifying Values:
```swift
// Reading values (returns optional)
let message = responseMessages[200]  // Optional("OK")

// Adding/updating values
responseMessages[301] = "Moved permanently"

// Removing a key-value pair
responseMessages[500] = nil
```

4. Iterating Over Dictionaries:
```swift
// Key-value pair iteration
for (name, path) in imagePaths {
    print("Path for '\(name)' is '\(path)'")
}

// Checking for specific conditions
let glyphIndex = imagePaths.firstIndex(where: { $0.value.hasPrefix("/glyphs") })
```

5. Key Methods and Properties:
- `isEmpty`: Check if dictionary is empty
- `count`: Number of key-value pairs
- `keys`: Collection of dictionary keys
- `values`: Collection of dictionary values
- `updateValue(_:forKey:)`: Update or insert a value
- `removeValue(forKey:)`: Remove a specific key-value pair

Best Practices:
- Use optional binding when accessing dictionary values
- Prefer `[key]?` for safe access
- Remember dictionaries are unordered collections
- Use `Hashable` types as keys

# Task Cancellation Handling in Swift

1. Purpose:
Provides a mechanism to execute an asynchronous operation with an immediate, guaranteed cancellation handler that runs even if the operation doesn't cooperatively check for cancellation.

2. Core Usage Pattern:
```swift
await withTaskCancellationHandler {
    // Main async operation
    var sum = 0
    while condition {
        sum += 1
    }
    return sum
} onCancel: {
    // Always runs immediately when task is canceled
    condition.cancel()
}
```

3. Key Behaviors:
- Cancellation handler runs immediately when task is canceled
- Operates even if original operation doesn't check cancellation status
- Works with already-canceled tasks
- Cancellation handler can execute concurrently with main operation

4. Safety Considerations:
- Be cautious with locks in cancellation handlers
- Avoid deadlocks by not holding locks during task cancellation
- Use for setting external flags or performing quick cleanup

Best Practice: Use `withTaskCancellationHandler` when you need guaranteed, immediate cleanup or signaling mechanisms for concurrent tasks, especially in scenarios with long-running operations that might not frequently check cancellation status.

# Arrays in Swift: Comprehensive Guide

1. Core Characteristics:
- Ordered, random-access collection type
- Can store elements of a single type
- Support dynamic sizing and flexible manipulation
- Value type with copy-on-write optimization

2. Creating Arrays:
```swift
// Array literals
let oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
var emptyArray: [String] = []

// Initializing with repeated values
var zeros = Array(repeating: 0, count: 5)
```

3. Key Access Patterns:
```swift
// Accessing elements
let firstElement = oddNumbers[0]  // First element
let lastElement = oddNumbers.last  // Optional last element

// Safe element access
if let first = oddNumbers.first {
    print("First element safely accessed")
}
```

4. Modification Methods:
```swift
// Adding elements
var students = ["Ben", "Ivy"]
students.append("Maxime")
students.insert("Liam", at: 1)

// Removing elements
students.remove(at: 0)
students.removeFirst()
students.removeLast()
```

5. Advanced Manipulation:
```swift
// Filtering and transforming
let evenNumbers = oddNumbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
let doubledNumbers = oddNumbers.map { $0 * 2 }

// Sorting
students.sort()
let sortedStudents = students.sorted { $0.count < $1.count }
```

6. Performance Considerations:
- Arrays grow exponentially to minimize reallocation
- Use `reserveCapacity(_:)` for predictable large collections
- Copy-on-write ensures efficient memory usage

Best Practice: 
- Prefer Swift array methods over manual index management
- Use optional binding and safe access methods
- Leverage built-in functional programming capabilities

# Migrating Objective-C to Swift: Strategic Approach

1. Migration Strategy:
- Migrate code incrementally, one class at a time
- Choose classes without subclasses first
- Replace `.m` and `.h` files with a single `.swift` file

2. Migration Steps:
```swift
// Example migration workflow
class MyOldClass: NSObject {  // Ensure Objective-C compatibility
    @objc(legacyMethodName)  // Preserve Objective-C method name
    func newSwiftMethod() {
        // Reimplemented logic
    }
}
```

3. Key Compatibility Requirements:
- Subclass from `NSObject` or another Objective-C class
- Use `@objc` attribute for Objective-C visibility
- Import bridging header if accessing Objective-C code
- Remove original Objective-C files from target after migration

4. Objective-C Interoperability Considerations:
- Can't subclass Swift classes in Objective-C
- Use `@objc(CustomName)` to control Objective-C-side naming
- Maintain method signatures compatible with original Objective-C implementation

Best Practices:
- Migrate incrementally
- Preserve existing class hierarchies
- Ensure smooth integration with existing Objective-C code
- Leverage Swift's type safety and modern language features
- Use Xcode's built-in migration tools and guidance

# Swift Strings: Advanced Unicode and Character Handling

1. Core String Characteristics:
- Represents a collection of Unicode characters
- Value type with copy-on-write optimization
- Unicode correct and locale-insensitive
- Efficient storage and manipulation

2. Unicode and Character Complexity:
```swift
// Different representations can be equal
let cafe1 = "Cafe\u{301}"   // Decomposed "é"
let cafe2 = "Café"          // Composed "é"
print(cafe1 == cafe2)       // true
```

3. String Representations:
- Extended Grapheme Clusters: Human-readable characters
- Multiple scalar values can form a single character
- Views for different encodings:
  - `unicodeScalars`: 21-bit Unicode scalar values
  - `utf16`: 16-bit code units
  - `utf8`: 8-bit code units

4. Accessing String Elements:
```swift
let name = "Marie Curie"
let firstSpace = name.firstIndex(of: " ") ?? name.endIndex
let firstName = name[..<firstSpace]  // Substring
```

5. Performance Considerations:
- Copy-on-write strategy
- Exponential buffer growth
- First mutation operation might be O(n)

Best Practice: Understand that strings are complex Unicode collections, and use appropriate methods for character-level operations. Choose the right view (`unicodeScalars`, `utf16`, `utf8`) based on your specific requirements.

- Useful in scientific, financial, and high-precision computing scenarios

# Double: In-Place Negation Operation

1. Purpose:
Mutates a floating-point value to its additive inverse (changes sign in-place)

2. Core Usage:
```swift
var x = 21.5
x.negate()  // x is now -21.5
```

3. Key Characteristics:
- Modifies the original value directly

    }

    // Implement custom hashing
    func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {
        hasher.combine(name)
        hasher.combine(position)
    }
}
```
